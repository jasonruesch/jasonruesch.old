<h1 i18n>About Me</h1>
<p i18n>
  I've spent the last {{ yearsOfExperience }} years learning everything there is
  to know about the software development industry--from website design to
  application development. I'm currently applying this knowledge in my role as
  Frontend Developer for Degreed, where I'm responsible for determining the
  structure and design of web pages, striking a balance between functional and
  aesthetic design and ensuring web design is optimized for mobile and desktop
  devices.
